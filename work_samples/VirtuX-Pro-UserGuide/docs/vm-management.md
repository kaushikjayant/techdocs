## Creating a Virtual Machine

### Step 1: Launch VirtuX Pro
1. Open the VirtuX Pro application.
2. Navigate to the **Virtual Machines** tab.
3. Click on **Create New VM**.

### Step 2: Define VM Settings
1. Enter a name for the VM.
2. Select the operating system type and version.
3. Choose the hardware configuration:
   - **CPU**: Allocate the number of processor cores.
   - **RAM**: Specify memory allocation.
   - **Storage**: Assign disk space and storage type (HDD/SSD).

### Step 3: Configure Boot Options
1. Attach an ISO image or a bootable disk.
2. Set boot priority (e.g., CD/DVD drive, network, or hard drive).
3. Click **Next** to proceed.

### Step 4: Finalize and Create VM
1. Review the summary of your configuration.
2. Click **Create** to complete the VM setup.
3. Start the VM to begin the installation of the selected operating system.

## Configuring Virtual Machines

### Adjusting VM Resources
1. Select the VM from the **Virtual Machines** tab.
2. Click **Edit Settings**.
3. Modify the following parameters as needed:
   - **CPU and RAM**: Adjust for performance optimization.
   - **Storage**: Expand disk space if required.
   - **Network**: Configure virtual network adapters (NAT, Bridged, Host-only).

### Managing Snapshots
1. Open the VM settings.
2. Navigate to the **Snapshots** section.
3. Click **Take Snapshot** to create a restore point.
4. Restore or delete snapshots as needed.

### Setting Up High Availability
1. Enable **High Availability (HA)** from the VM settings.
2. Configure failover settings to ensure uptime.
3. Assign HA policies based on workload priority.

## Optimizing Virtual Machines

### Performance Enhancements
- **Enable VirtuX Tools**: Install guest additions for better integration.
- **Adjust CPU Affinity**: Assign specific cores for better performance.
- **Enable Disk Caching**: Optimize disk I/O operations.
- **Manage Memory Usage**: Use dynamic memory allocation where applicable.

### Backup and Recovery
- **Automate Backups**: Schedule regular VM backups.
- **Use Snapshot Rollback**: Quickly revert to a previous state.
- **Export VM Configuration**: Save VM settings for migration or replication.

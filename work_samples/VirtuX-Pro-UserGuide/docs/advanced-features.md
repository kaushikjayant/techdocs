# Advanced Features of VirtuX Pro

VirtuX Pro offers a range of advanced features designed to enhance virtualization efficiency, resilience, and scalability. This document covers details on **Snapshots**, **High Availability (HA)**, and **Cloud Integration**.

## Snapshots
Snapshots allow users to capture the state of a virtual machine (VM) at a specific moment. This is useful for testing configurations, rolling back changes, and maintaining system integrity.

### Key Features:
- **Point-in-time Recovery**: Quickly restore VMs to a previous state.
- **Multiple Snapshots**: Maintain multiple recovery points.
- **Minimal Performance Impact**: Optimized snapshot management reduces storage overhead.
- **Automated Snapshots**: Configure scheduled snapshots for better reliability.

### How to Create a Snapshot:
1. Open the **VirtuX Pro Management UI**.
2. Navigate to the **Virtual Machines** section.
3. Select the VM for which you want to create a snapshot.
4. Click on **Create Snapshot** and provide a name.
5. Confirm and wait for the snapshot process to complete.

### Restoring a Snapshot:
1. Go to **Snapshots** under the selected VM.
2. Choose the desired snapshot.
3. Click **Restore** to revert the VM to the selected state.

## High Availability (HA)
High Availability ensures minimal downtime by automatically detecting and recovering from VM or hardware failures.

### Key Features:
- **Automatic Failover**: If a node fails, VMs are automatically restarted on another healthy node.
- **Load Balancing**: Evenly distributes workloads across available nodes.
- **Heartbeat Monitoring**: Continuously checks VM and host health.
- **Self-Healing Mechanism**: Automatically attempts to restart failed services.

### Enabling High Availability:
1. Open the **VirtuX Pro Cluster Manager**.
2. Navigate to **HA Configuration**.
3. Enable HA and specify the failover policy.
4. Add nodes to the HA cluster.
5. Save the configuration and monitor HA status in the dashboard.

### Supported Cloud Platforms:
- **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**
- **Microsoft Azure**
- **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**
- **Private OpenStack Clouds**

### Cloud Integration Features:
- **Live Migration**: Move VMs between on-premises and cloud environments without downtime.
- **Automated Backups**: Configure cloud storage for periodic VM backups.
- **Scalability**: Dynamically allocate cloud resources based on demand.
- **Security**: Encrypted VM transfers and secure authentication mechanisms.

### Configuring Cloud Integration:
1. Open **VirtuX Pro Cloud Settings**.
2. Select your cloud provider and enter authentication credentials.
3. Choose the VMs or workloads to sync with the cloud.
4. Configure policies for backup, migration, and scaling.
5. Save settings and initiate synchronization.

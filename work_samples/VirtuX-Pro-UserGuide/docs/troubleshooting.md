## Common Issues and Solutions

### 1. Installation Issues
#### Problem: Installation Fails or Freezes
**Possible Causes:**
- Insufficient system resources
- Incomplete download or corrupted installer
- Conflicting software

**Solution:**
1. Ensure your system meets the minimum requirements for VirtuX Pro.
2. Download the installer again from the official website.
3. Disable antivirus software temporarily during installation.
4. Run the installer as an administrator (Windows) or use `sudo` (Linux/macOS).

### 2. Virtual Machine (VM) Won't Start
#### Problem: VM Fails to Launch
**Possible Causes:**
- Insufficient memory or CPU allocation
- Conflicting hypervisors
- Corrupt VM configuration

**Solution:**
1. Ensure the VM has enough allocated resources.
2. Check if another hypervisor (e.g., Hyper-V, VMware) is conflicting; disable unnecessary hypervisors.
3. Restore the VM configuration from a backup.
4. Check logs for specific error messages.

### 3. Performance Issues
#### Problem: VM Running Slowly
**Possible Causes:**
- Insufficient CPU or RAM allocation
- High host system resource usage
- Disk I/O bottlenecks

**Solution:**
1. Increase CPU and RAM allocation in VM settings.
2. Close unnecessary applications on the host machine.
3. Use SSD storage instead of HDD for better performance.
4. Enable VirtuX Pro performance optimizations in settings.

### 4. Network Connectivity Problems
#### Problem: VM Cannot Access the Internet
**Possible Causes:**
- Incorrect network adapter settings
- Firewall or security software blocking access
- Network misconfiguration

**Solution:**
1. Ensure the correct network adapter is selected (NAT, Bridged, Host-only, etc.).
2. Temporarily disable firewalls or security software to check for conflicts.
3. Run `ping` or `traceroute` commands to diagnose network connectivity.
4. Restart the VM and network adapter.

### 5. Snapshot and Backup Issues
#### Problem: Unable to Create or Restore Snapshots
**Possible Causes:**
- Insufficient disk space
- Corrupt snapshot file
- VM is running during snapshot restore

**Solution:**
1. Ensure sufficient disk space is available for snapshots.
2. Shut down the VM before restoring snapshots.
3. Delete and recreate snapshots if corruption is suspected.

### 6. Cloud Integration Issues
#### Problem: Unable to Connect to Cloud Storage
**Possible Causes:**
- Incorrect credentials or permissions
- Network connectivity issues
- Cloud service downtime

**Solution:**
1. Verify cloud service credentials and permissions.
2. Check for network connectivity using `ping` or `nslookup`.
3. Confirm that the cloud service is operational by checking the providerâ€™s status page.

# NetPulse Overview 

NetPulse is a cloud enabled assurance platform addressing the intelligence and automation requirements in assuring a hybrid or Network Function Virtualization \(NFV\) ready network. It unifies modelling, ingestion, analytics, presentation, and inter-system interactions to provide for a seamless deployment across the network.

**Important:** NFV is a new way to design, deploy and manage networking services, which decouples the network functions from proprietary hardware appliances so they can run in software. A hybrid network is one, which utilizes both NFV and physical network functions.

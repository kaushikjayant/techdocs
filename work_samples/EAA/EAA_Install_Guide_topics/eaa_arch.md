## NetPulse Architecture

NetPulse applications are built on a structured architecture comprising multiple layers, each serving a distinct purpose. These layers include:

### **Infrastructure Layer**
The **Infrastructure Layer** provides the fundamental IT resources required for NetPulse applications. NetPulse can operate on various types of infrastructure, including public cloud, private cloud, and bare metal environments. The infrastructure provisioning process is tailored to the specific needs of each deployment.

### **Platform as a Service (PaaS) Layer**
The **PaaS Layer** delivers essential domain-agnostic services, such as platform operations, database management, and network control. These services ensure a stable and scalable foundation for NetPulse applications.

### **Common Services and Applications**
The **Common Services Layer** encompasses domain-specific services essential to NetPulse operations. It is further categorized into the following functional groups:

- **Domain-Related Services and Web Applications:** These components provide access to and management of network inventories, ensuring seamless integration and operation.
- **Big Data Processing:** This includes analytical components that support advanced data analytics within NetPulse.
- **Non-Functional Services:** These encompass transversal functionalities, such as monitoring, security (authentication and authorization), and automation, which enhance the reliability and efficiency of the platform.
